MLE of some circular distributions
}

\description{
MLE of some circular distributions.
}

\usage{
circ.mle(x, rads = FALSE, distr = "vm", N = 2, tol = 1e-07, maxiters = 100)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A numerical vector with the circular data. They must be expressed in radians. For the "spml.mle" this can also be a matrix with two columns, the cosinus and the sinus of the circular data.
}
\item{rads}{
If the data are in radians set this to TRUE.
}
\item{distr}{
The type of distribution to fit, "vm" stands for the von Mises, "spml" is the angular Gaussian and "wrapcauchy" is the wrapped Cauchy distribution, "circexp" and "circbeta" stand for the circular exponential and the circular beta distributions, respectively. "cardio" is the cardioid distribution and "ggvm" is the generalized von Mises distribution, "cipc" is the circular independent projected Cauchy, "gcpc" is the generalised circular projected Cauchy distribution and "mmvm" is the multi-modal von Mises distribution.
}
\item{N}{
The number of modes to consider in the multi-modal von Mises distribution.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance level to stop the iterative process of finding the MLEs.
}
\item{maxiters}{
The maximum number of iterations to implement.
}
}

\details{
The parameters of the bivariate angular Gaussian (spml.mle), wrapped Cauchy, circular exponential,
cardioid, circular beta, geometrically generalised von Mises, CIPC (reparametrised version of the
wrapped Cauchy), GCPC (generalisation of the CIPC) and multi-modal von Mises distributions are
estimated. For the Wrapped Cauchy, the iterative procedure described by Kent and Tyler (1988) is
used. The Newton-Raphson algortihm for the angular Gaussian is described in the regression setting
in Presnell et al. (1998). The circular exponential is also known as wrapped exponential distribution.
}

\value{
A list including:
\item{iters}{
The iterations required until convergence. This is returned in the wrapped Cauchy distribution only.
}
\item{param}{
A vector consisting of the estimates of the two parameters, the mean direction for both distributions
and the concentration parameter \eqn{\kappa} and the \eqn{\rho} for the von Mises (and the multi-modal von Mises) and wrapped Cauchy respectively. For the circular beta this contains the mean angle and the \eqn{\alpha} and \eqn{\beta} parameters. For the cardioid distribution this contains the \eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\rho} parameters. For the generalised von Mises this is a vector consisting of the \eqn{\zeta}, \eqn{\kappa}, \eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\alpha} parameters of the generalised von Mises distribution as described in Equation (2.7) of Dietrich and Richter (2017).
}
\item{gamma}{
The norm of the mean vector of the angular Gaussian, the CIPC and the GCPC distributions.
}
\item{mu}{
The mean vector of the angular Gaussian, the CIPC and the GCPC distributions.
}
\item{mumu}{
In the case of "angular Gaussian distribution this is the mean angle in radians.
}
\item{circmu}{
In the case of the CIPC and the GCPC this is the mean angle in radians.
}
\item{rho}{
For the GCPC distribution this is the eigenvalue of the covariance matrix, or the covariance determinant.
}
\item{lambda}{
The lambda parameter of the circular exponential distribution.
}
