\title{
Column-wise MLE of distributions defined in the (0, 1) interval
}

\description{
Column-wise MLE of distributions defined in the (0, 1) interval.
}

\usage{
colprop.mle(x, distr = "beta", tol = 1e-07)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A numerical vector with proportions, i.e. numbers in (0, 1) (zeros and ones are not allowed).
}
\item{distr}{
The ditribution to fit. "beta" stands for the beta distribution, "logitnorm" is the logistic normal.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance level up to which the maximisation stops.
}
}

\details{
Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of the beta distribution is performed via Newton-Raphson.
The distributions and hence the functions does not accept zeros. "logitnorm.mle" fits the logistic normal,
hence no nwewton-Raphson is required and the "hypersecant01.mle" uses the golden ratio
search as is it faster than the Newton-Raphson (less calculations).
}

\value{
A list including:
\item{iters}{
The number of iterations required by the Newton-Raphson.
}
\item{loglik}{
The value of the log-likelihood.
}
\item{param}{
The estimated parameters. In the case of "hypersecant01.mle" this is called
"theta" as there is only one parameter.
}
