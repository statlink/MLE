MLE of some distributions for compositional data

\description{
MLE of some distributions for compositional data.
}

\usage{
comp.mle(x, distr = "diri", type = 1, a = NULL, tol = 1e-07)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A matrix containing the compositional data. Zeros are not allowed, except for the "ZADR" which was developed for this case.
}
\item{distr}{
The distribution to fit, "diri" stands for the Dirichlet distribution, "zad" stands for the zero adjusted Dirichlet distribution (ZADR), "afold" stands for the \eqn{\alpha}-folded normal and "anorm" stands for the \eqn{\alpha}-normal distribution.
}
\item{type}{
Type 1 uses a vectorised version of the Newton-Raphson (Minka, 2012). In high dimensions this is to be preferred.
If the data are too concentrated, regardless of the dimensions, this is also to be preferrred.
Type 2 uses the regular Newton-Raphson, with matrix multiplications. In small dimensions this can be considerably
faster.
}
\item{a}{
A value of \eqn{\alpha}.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance level idicating no further increase in the log-likelihood.
}
}

\details{
Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution is performed via Newton-Raphson.
Initial values suggested by Minka (2012) are used. Also, MLE of the ZADR, \eqn{\alpha}-folded normal and the \eqn{\alpha}-normal distributions are provided.
}

\value{
A list including:
\item{loglik}{
The value of the log-likelihood.
}
\item{param}{
The estimated parameters.
}
\item{phi}{
The precision parameter of the ZADR distribution.
}
\item{mu}{
The mean vector of the distribution.
}
\item{su}{
The estimated covariance matrix of the folded model.
}
\item{alpha}{
If the argument "a" was not given it will be computed and be returned.
}
\item{p}{
The estimated probability inside the simplex of the \eqn{\alpha}-folded normal model.
}
\item{iters}{
The number of iterations the EM algorithm required.
}
\item{runtime}{
The time required by the regression.
}
