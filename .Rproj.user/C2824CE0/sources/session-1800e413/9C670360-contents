MLE of continuous univariate distributions defined on the real line}

\description{
MLE of continuous univariate distributions defined on the real line.
}

\usage{
real.mle(x, distr = "normal", v = 5, tol = 1e-7)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A numerical vector with data.
}
\item{distr}{
The distribution to fit, "normal" stands for the normal distribution, "gumbel" for the Gumbel, "cauchy" for the Cauchy, "logistic"
for the logistic distribution, "ct" for the (central) t distribution, "t" for the (non-central) t distribution, "wigner" is the
Wigner semicircle distribution and "laplace" is the Laplace distribution.
}
\item{v}{
The degrees of freedom of the t distribution.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance level up to which the maximisation stops set to 1e-07 by default.
}
}

\details{
Instead of maximising the log-likelihood via a numerical optimiser we have used a Newton-Raphson algorithm which
is faster. See wikipedia for the equation to be solved. For the t distribution we need the degrees of freedom and
estimate the location and scatter parameters.

The Cauchy is the t distribution with 1 degree of freedom. The Laplace distribution is also called
double exponential distribution.
}

\value{
Usually a list with three elements, but this is not for all cases.
\item{iters}{The number of iterations required for the Newton-Raphson to converge.}
\item{loglik}{The value of the maximised log-likelihood.}
\item{param}{The vector of the parameters.}
}
